Spring security.

http.sessionManagement() - defines session management behaviour for http request.

SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS - 
  (application will not create or use an HTTP session to store security-related information.
  Security is implemented without relying on server-side sessions, meaning:
    Each request is authenticated independently.
    Typically used in stateless applications (e.g., RESTful APIs).
    Authentication information (like a JWT) must be sent with every request.)
    
    
Allowed Headers - allowed headers that frontend can send to backend.
Exposed Headers = headers that backend will send in response to frontend.


OncePerRequestFilter - Filter that is applied once per request. Handy when working with multiple servlets.

Repo for jwt in springboot maven - https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt


Authentication starts from 'Authentication Provider' , it is in security config file with @Bean.
It implements something called DaoAuthenticationProvider which checks user credentials is stored in database or not and only if it is in database , it will allow you access.
We can set password encoder to encode it to a type to store in database as we cannot store raw passwords.
Then we call a very important called .setUserDetailsService. Here we should pass UserDetailsService class.

Make the custom implementation of UserDetailsService class , this has a method called loadByUsername (String username). this username comes from the name you enter in login form and then it checks in the repo
if any record of that username is available or not. If not available (null) it will throw exception , hence no acess. But if there is one, you need to return UserDetails (which is spirngsecurity way of visualizing user). So for this also you have to make a class implementing UserDetails. This class ties UserDetails with our custom user. 

If user is found , we create UserDetails object by passing our user which was found in repo.

If we only have AuthenticationProvider , it only tests the username and not the password. If the username is right you will gain access , how funny is that.

But why are we using authManager's New UserPasswordauthenticationTOken(username,password) to verify for login if we have AutheticationProvider self defined that can verify usrename password against database , this is because authManager under the hood uses our custom implementation!

Implementing jwt token. Every authentication after login must be verified with jwt token. On login it gives you jwt token , but why does not /login or /register require jwt token. Because in .requestMatchers("/login") .permitAll().

For other request that need to be authenticated. JwtFilter() is added before UserNamePasswordAuthentication Filter. so it will authenticate with jwt token.

In jwt filter , first we strip bearer token from the header. and then validate (validate function in jwtUtils) , after validating create a username password authentication token and set it to security context to allow passing through jwt key.

Since userName password authentication token is set to security context holder , it no longer redirects to login form for the username password authentication token , becuase we create it after validation and pass to security context.
